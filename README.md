Containers
==========

Some custom containers I've written for various projects.

* A multi list type structure where elements can be in more than one list at a time (akin to [Boost.Intrusive](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_55_0/doc/html/intrusive.html))
* A deque with fast erasing, appending and splitting (does not maintain ordering).

Disclaimer: these are in no way standards complient and were designed/written for specific tasks.
